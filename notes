Q's for Barbara

1. dimensions for adduct show that there are 398 individuals != ~700 of protein and metabol

2. For quantile regression imputation, I have found the miWQS package.
It uses 'univariate bayesian imputation' based on the detectable limits.

	2a) Is this ok? SHould we impute all these in eveey single dataset one at a time
		or make a mega-dataset with all omics in 1 and	_then_ impute?
	2b) What are the detectable limits? Taking the minimum of the range? We could pass
		the minimum observed value of each metabolite as the DL but this is not
		100% true. It is also highly variable among assays (0-400).
not the case in clustering. we dont need indeependent 

----------------
For Aim 1, case/ control status as an outcome in a logistic regression



For MI
Good idea to combine them all for the imputation.

Might need to check if we have the same n of observations.

If the sample size is different, we apply MI to the intersection
BUT we will be losing data. SO impute metabolomics + protein together
AND adductomics separately.

FOr metabolomics data, missingnes is because metabolites are in very small
concentrations. FIRSTLY, remove samples for whom missingness is >60%.


For detectable limit, We DO NOT TAKE THE SMALLEST OBSERVED VALUE. 
TAKE THE SMALLEST VALUE AND DIVIDE BY SQRT(2).

WE DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS IN imputeLCMD

------------------------
For univariate, 1 variable (eg. 1 protein)
For multivariate, all of the proteins in 1 model. Multicollinearity 
as it is not invertible. penalised models (partial least squares).

First, easy analysis to use all samples, OUTCOME CANCER OR NOT.


For each OMIC, a list of significant variables afte 1st aim.
IN THE SECOND AIM, ONLY FOR THE SIGNIFICANT ONES, CLUSTERING ON THE
VARIABLES. NO INFORMATION FROM COVARS DATASET INITIALLY, MAYBE LATER.

For ROC curves, compare protein, mtb, adduct, prt+mtb+adduct
